# EscapeTheBackrooms Internal Trainer
---

## About
A simple Trainer for the Game "Escape The Backrooms" for messing around a little with the Game.
I made this with the Objective of learning a little more about the Inner Workings and reverse Engineering in Unreal Engine Games.

## Legality and Ethicality

This Project was just made for **Educational Purposes**. **It was never my intention to create an Cheat to Destroy other Peoples gaming Experience** even if i experimented a little around with some Techniques to do so (With Friends not random Players).
So Use this Project just for Educational Purposes or to have fun, don´t be an Asshole🧙‍♂️, Always Respect and Support small Game Developer Studios and their Work❤️
